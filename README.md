# About:

A simple bash script written by me that I wrote for myself but figured I would share.

# Requirements:

## Windows user:
- [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) or [Linux WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) (it will work slower, and need [Zulu JDK 17 64-bit for Linux](https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu17.36.13-ca-jdk17.0.4-linux_amd64.deb))
- [Zulu JDK 17 64-bit for Windows](https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu17.36.13-ca-jdk17.0.4-win_x64.msi)
- Relatively stable internet to download the required packages and applications

During installation Git for Windows, choose the following options:
```
- Git from the command line and also 3rd-party software
- Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style endings
- Use MinTTY (the default terminal MSYS2)
```
## Linux user
- [Zulu JDK 17 64-bit for Linux](https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu17.36.13-ca-jdk17.0.4-linux_amd64.deb)
- Relatively stable internet to download the required packages and applications

## How to use

1. Create any folder and put the ReVanced.sh script there
2. Run script in 2 ways:
- Launch git shell by right-clicking in an empty folder space and selecting "Git Bash Here", then run script by typing: ./ReVanced.sh
